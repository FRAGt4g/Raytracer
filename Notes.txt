TL;DR: Make spheres, and then import to buffer from scene, and then make triangles

The way to render images from within the scene view is just by passing them into a buffer to the
shader. He also was using an unlit shader if that matters but idk.

Start with spheres and finish out that first paper you were looking at; once you are done with that,
then you can start working on getting multiple in editor spheres into the render AND THEN you can 
start working on triangles (and all other kinds of models).
